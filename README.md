# Welcome!
Thank you for visiting my repository.  I only started uploading files to github within the last few months, when I decided to make the change in life to follow my passion and become a full stack developer.

I started programming back in 2000 using basic HTML and CSS, at that point I stumbled upon a block based website "phpnuke'.  It was at that time I started to learn backend programming.  Now I've continued to pursue my passion and learn the latest stacks, frameworks and technologies.

## Stacks
| Frontend     | Backend      | Frameworks     |
|______________|______________|________________|
| HTML         | PHP          | Bootstrap 5    |
| CSS3         | Laravel      | Tailwind CSS   |
| SCSS         | MySQL        | jQuery         |
| JavaScript   | NodeJS       | -              |
| VueJS        | -            | -              |

My knowledge will constantly expand as I have a passion for challenges and forcing myself to think outside of the box.  My current goals are to learn React, Python and dive deeper into MongoDB and Firebase (I have learned the basics of working with these NOSQL databases, but I wouldnt say im 100% comfortable with them.
